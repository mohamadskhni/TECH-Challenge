# Automated Multi-Environment Service Deployment and Monitoring - Plan

## Information Gathered
- Task requires automating deployment of at least two microservices/web apps across three environments: dev, stg, prod.
- Deployment pipeline should deploy services sequentially through environments (dev → stg → prod).
- CI/CD tool to manage pipeline locally (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions local runner).
- IaC tool to set up and manage environments locally (e.g., Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible).
- Containerize services using Docker.
- Orchestrate using Kubernetes (Minikube) or Docker Compose.
- Monitoring with Kuma Uptime for availability and uptime across all environments.
- Deliverables include code repo with all configs, README, and live demo.

## Detailed Plan

### Services
- Create two simple Node.js microservices (service-a and service-b).
- Each service will have:
  - Basic REST API (e.g., GET /health returning status).
  - Dockerfile for containerization.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Use Terraform or Pulumi to:
  - Provision Minikube cluster locally (or assume Minikube installed).
  - Create Kubernetes namespaces for dev, stg, prod.
  - Deploy Kuma service mesh and Kuma Uptime monitoring.
  - Deploy services to respective namespaces.

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Use GitHub Actions with local runner or Jenkins pipeline.
- Pipeline stages:
  1. Build Docker images for service-a and service-b.
  2. Push images to local Docker registry or use Minikube's Docker daemon.
  3. Deploy to dev namespace.
  4. Run tests/health checks.
  5. Deploy to stg namespace.
  6. Run tests/health checks.
  7. Deploy to prod namespace.
  8. Run tests/health checks.
- Pipeline config files (e.g., .github/workflows/deploy.yml or Jenkinsfile).

### Kubernetes Manifests
- Deployment and Service YAMLs for each service.
- Use environment-specific namespaces.
- Configure Kuma sidecar injection for monitoring.

### Kuma Uptime Monitoring
- Install Kuma on Minikube.
- Configure Kuma Uptime to monitor service endpoints in all namespaces.
- Expose Kuma dashboard locally.

### README
- Instructions to:
  - Install prerequisites (Minikube, Docker, Terraform/Pulumi, GitHub Actions runner or Jenkins).
  - Setup and run the pipeline.
  - Access Kuma dashboard.
  - Verify deployments and monitoring.

## Dependent Files to be Created
- service-a/Dockerfile, app.js
- service-b/Dockerfile, app.js
- k8s/dev/, k8s/stg/, k8s/prod/ manifests
- terraform/ or pulumi/ scripts
- .github/workflows/deploy.yml or Jenkinsfile
- README.md

## Follow-up Steps
- Implement services and Dockerfiles.
- Implement IaC scripts.
- Implement CI/CD pipeline config.
- Setup Kuma Uptime monitoring manifests.
- Write README.
- Test full deployment and monitoring locally.
